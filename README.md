Things to do:
- use altro to generate dynamically-feasible trajectory
- debug wind-compensation in MPC get_control() function
- add noise to measurements and dynamics
- make state measurements just pose

Some notes:
- to add a package, you need to add it to Project.toml (and probably delete Manifest.toml and rebuild)
