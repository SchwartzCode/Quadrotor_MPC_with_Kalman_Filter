Things to do:
- rewrite line and flip trajectory generation functions in quadrotor.jl (either)
- implement toggle-able wind disturbance in quadrotor.jl (Corinne)\
    - [brown note](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFL-NLh0O8)
    - [okay but actually this sounds really nice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXetO_bYcMo)
- implement LQR controller to verify everything kind of works (Jonathan)
- write out constraints for MPC (Jonathan)
- re-write MPC functions to work for this system (Jonathan)

Some notes:
- to add a package, you need to add it to Project.toml (and probably delete Manifest.toml and rebuild)
