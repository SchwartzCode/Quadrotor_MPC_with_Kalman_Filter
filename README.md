Things to do:
- implement toggle-able wind disturbance in quadrotor.jl (Corinne)\
    - [brown note](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFL-NLh0O8)
    - [okay but actually this sounds really nice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXetO_bYcMo)
- adjust MPC to sim forward in time and re-linearize dynamics along predicted trajectory
- add KF to MPC (Jonathan)
    - review notes Zac sent then meet with him to discuss (both)

Some notes:
- to add a package, you need to add it to Project.toml (and probably delete Manifest.toml and rebuild)
